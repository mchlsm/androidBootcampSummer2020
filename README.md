I recently discovered Kotlin and I'm working hard to become an Android dev.
It's very challenging but also exciting. I'm thankful to be part of RW's
Android Bootcamp and learning a ton of things every day. I cannot wait to see
what my classmates create for their final project. I hope they'll like mine!
Outside of programming, I love to run, play music and write.
